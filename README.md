- **Gameplay:**
  - When you click on the deck, a card is revealed.
  - If it's a cat card, it's discarded from the deck.
  - If it's an exploding kitten and you lack a defuse card, you lose the game.
  - f it's a defuse card, it‚Äôs removed and saved to counter any future exploding kitten card.
  - If it‚Äôs a shuffle card, the deck reshuffles and the game restarts.
  - To win, draw all cards that aren‚Äôt exploding kittens.
## Accessing the Game Locally

### For Node.js (React Frontend):
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the frontend server: `npm start`
3. Access the game at: `http://localhost:3000`

### For Go Lang (Backend):
1. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
2. Build the Go server: `go build -o main`
3. Start the server: `./main`

### For Redis DB(Backend):

#### Step 1: Install Redis

First, you need to install Redis on your system. You can download and install Redis from the official website or use package managers like `apt` or `brew` depending on your operating system.

#### Step 2: Start Redis Server

Start the Redis server on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
redis-server
redis-server-start
```

This command will start the Redis server with default configurations.


#### Step 3: Close Redis Connection

Don't forget to close the Redis connection when you're done:

```bash
redis-server-stop
```
That's it! You've successfully set up Redis for your project and connected to it using Go Lang. Now you can use Redis to store and retrieve data as needed.
